# Final Exam Practice and Evaluation
THis is Final Exam Practice for Advanced Computing and Big Data course.

Our task is to reproduce requested Collaborative Filtering models.

The Code to Reproduce: https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-oncollaborative-filtering.

I used Google Collab to rerun Python Notebook Codes and give comments on the codes, then published it in my Git folder named it (Final-Exam-KLBD) which is this one.
